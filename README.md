# csgo-mapvote
csgo-mapvote is a tool to reach a consensus on a CS:GO map pool while playing with friends.

## mvp
The current state is a mvp and provides only basic functionality. There is only one mode: Each player has one vote and one veto.  
There is no session handling, so the tool can be used by one group of max. 5 players only.

## installation
The tool relies on node.js. So just navigate into the main directory and run ```npm i```

## demo
